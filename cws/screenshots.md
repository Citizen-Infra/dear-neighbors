# Screenshot Guide for CWS Listing

CWS accepts 1-5 screenshots at **1280x800** or **640x400** pixels (PNG or JPEG).

Recommended set of 4 screenshots:

## 1. New Tab Dashboard (light mode)
- Open a new tab with the extension loaded
- Set location to Novi Sad / Liman (has seeded data)
- Make sure there are a few links visible with votes
- Show the full layout: top bar, links feed (left), participation panel (right)
- Window size: **1280x800**

## 2. Link Submission
- Click "Share a link" to open the submit form
- Paste a URL so the title/description auto-populate
- Select a couple of topic chips
- Capture the form overlay on top of the dashboard

## 3. Browser Popup
- Navigate to any news article or blog post
- Click the Dear Neighbors extension icon in the toolbar
- Capture the popup with the page title pre-filled
- Use Chrome's screenshot or a tool like Greenshot — the popup is 400px wide

## 4. Dark Mode
- Open settings, switch to dark theme
- Capture the full new tab dashboard in dark mode
- Same Novi Sad / Liman location with links visible

## How to capture at exact dimensions
